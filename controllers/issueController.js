Dormant forever until my glance set foot upon it and it woke and came charging for me. <br><br>And to think that this will happen for a million others. The same surface holding something different for each person, just waiting for that particular look, at that particular time, and it lets loose that unique reaction, formed over millenia and birthed in the space of an eye twitch.<br><br>To think how many impressions are held in each spotted shade of existence... A bird's wing, made up of as many feathers as there are reactions to those feathers. Glistening like the eyeballs that will perceive them.",

    content: "Take nothing, &ldquo;not even take photos.&rdquo; <br><br>I used to think that. I thought the experience was most pure if you left it exactly as you found it. Then you could be sure that whatever you got from it was original and made only of it's self. <br><br>But, I don't think that any more. Mostly because I tend to forget things, but also because any memento you take, even if it exists entirely in your head‚Äî you've still taken it from there. It didn't come from you, it came from there. So if you wanted to truly take NOTHING, you'd have to never see it, sense it, smell it, anything it really. Your mind's just a biological camera, 3D, smell-o-vision... so take what you want. Take photos, take stones, take leaves, stamp 'em in a book. Hell, take a whole tree, plant it in your garden, let that experience last forever, pass it down to your grandchildren, or your neighbour's grandchildren, anyone. Not that they'll need it‚Äì there's about a bazillion things waiting for them to take.",

My eyeballs feel like two planets in the front of my skull, my entire existence, my entire experience channelled through them. How could I think any other way? When the world is so complete right there within me. Two times over, even.<br><br>It's only when I think about how much remains outside of them that I realise how wrong I am. I think about it and it's like they start to leak out of me. I imagine them emanating little silver waves into the air. Little shimmers that mark their evaporation right out of me. I can almost watch them go.. until I have no eyes to watch them with. My vision and my concentration go too... off into the oneness.<br><br>...and yet they're still there! And they still feel like the world perched in my skull‚Äì the whole of everything balanced on the two little curves of bone that make the base of my eye sockets.",

I feel so small and weak and shrunken in on my self that I am completely reassured of my tinyness in the face of the grandness. My impermanence in the face of the endless. My destructability in the face of that which can never be destroyed. <p>The ocean is it's perfect representative. That which holds it's strength in it's shapelessness and it's scope. I throw myself at it like a pebble at a mountain. If you even looked away from where the pebble landed, you'd never even know it had been thrown.</p><br>I like this feeling of having no control over anything beyond my body. I am at the whim of everything beyond me. The tide could suck me down, the waves could bowl me over, the cold can make me think of nothing but the cold.
